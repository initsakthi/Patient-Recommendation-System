            <h3 >Protecting Your  From Toxic Algae</h3>
            <p>In these  days of summer, many people take their pets with them on outdoor adventures. But, pet owners need to be aware of a danger that can threaten their dogs’ lives: toxic algae blooms. A deadly species of algae is believed to have caused the recent deaths of several dogs across the United States. Several cases were reported at Texas, North Carolina, and Massachusetts lakes.

Blue-green algae is on the rise in freshwater and saltwater ponds, rivers, and lakes, especially in warm and humid climates. If you notice that the water looks cloudier, it may be contaminated, so do not let your pets drink or swim in it. Blue-green algae emits a noticeable smell. Areas near the water may also contain algae in the soil.

Even a small exposure can cause harm due to two toxins within the algae called microcystins and anatoxins, which the Centers for Disease Control named as “among the most powerful natural poisons known.” These toxins are not visible.

Signs of algae poisoning appear within an hour and can include confusion, lethargy, discoloration, tremors, seizures, and difficulty breathing, according to Pets WebMD. Damage to the liver and metabolic system is also possible, and the most likely cause of death by algae poisoning. Cases have been documented in all animals, but dogs are affected most severely.

Before taking your pets to outdoor sites, check for any environmental advisories from your local Parks and Recreation department. If you have standing water in your yard, try to keep your pets away from it.

Symptoms can appear within minutes to hours. If your pet does become ill, or if you suspect any algae exposure, take action quickly. Rinse your dog off first. Consult with both a veterinarian and an animal poison control specialist immediately, so they can begin pumping toxins out of their body and treating any affected organs. Pet insurance plans with accident-illness coverage or veterinary discount programs will ensure that you get the right care, and lessen the cost of treatment when unexpected issues arise.

<h3> Heartworm Disease in Dogs: Symptoms, Treatment & Reducing Costs</h3>
<p>
All dogs are susceptible to heartworm disease, regardless of their sex, age, breed or living environment. In general, wherever there are mosquitoes, there is potential for heartworm infection (dirofilaria immitis) in dogs. This means that heartworms are a potential threat in many countries around the world, as well as in all 50 US states and are a concern all 12 months of the year. In the States, the disease is most common along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, as well as along the Mississippi River.
In other words, symptoms might not be obvious in pups that are not very active, that have been recently infected, or have low worm burdens. When symptoms appear, your four-legged companion could already have a large heartworm burden.

Early signs of heartworm infection in dogs include occasional coughing, shortness of breath, and tiredness after moderate activity otherwise known as exercise intolerance.

<h3>Petfinder: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Eventually, Betsy sought corporate sponsorship to expand the website’s capabilities and ensure it could remain free for adopters and shelters.

Since then, Petfinder launched a foundation and has donated more than $10 million to shelters and animal rescue groups. They’ve even launched an iPhone app.

Petfinder’s primary purpose is to match potential pet parents with adoptable pets. And it uses the power of search technology to help users find the perfect pet for their home and family.

Instead of having to travel to various shelters, potential pet parents can search the database to get an idea of which pet they’d like to adopt.

The tool is particularly helpful for thoses who have a disability, don’t have much free time, or don’t have access to reliable transportation.</p>
